# INHERITX Backend

A Rust-based backend for the INHERITX crypto system, built on Stellar network with Soroban smart contracts.

## Architecture

The INHERITX backend provides the following services:

- **Identity & Wallet Service**: User management and Stellar address resolution
- **Anchor Integration Service**: SEP-24/SEP-31 integration for fiat on/off ramps
- **Compliance & Risk Engine**: Sanctions screening and transaction monitoring
- **Transaction Log & Audit Service**: Immutable audit trails
- **Admin Dashboard API**: System monitoring and management
- **Indexer / Ledger Listener**: Stellar network event monitoring

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Stellar CLI (optional, for development)

### Setup

1. **Clone and navigate to backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Database setup:**
   ```bash
   # Create PostgreSQL database
   createdb inheritx

   # Set environment variables
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database URL and other settings
   ```

4. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin migrate
   ```

5. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.


## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Code Formatting

```bash
cargo fmt
```

### Linting

```bash
cargo clippy
```

### Database Migrations

Migrations are automatically run on startup. To manually run migrations:

```bash
cargo run --bin migrate
```

## Security Considerations

- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours by default
- All user funds remain non-custodial
- Transactions are signed client-side
- Compliance checks are performed on all transactions
- Audit logs are immutable and comprehensive

## Rate Limiting

The backend enforces rate limiting on all API endpoints. Standard headers are returned in HTTP responses to allow clients to monitor their usage limits and implement backoff strategies:

* **`x-ratelimit-limit`**: The maximum number of requests allowed in the rate limit burst/window.
* **`x-ratelimit-remaining`**: The number of requests remaining in the current window.
* **`x-ratelimit-reset`**: The Unix epoch timestamp (in seconds) when the rate limit quota resets / fully replenishes.
* **`retry-after`**: The number of seconds the client must wait before retrying (returned only on `429 Too Many Requests` responses).

These headers are exposed via CORS configuration to browser-based clients (`Access-Control-Expose-Headers`).

## Deployment

The backend is designed to be deployed as a single binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/inheritx-backend
```

Use environment variables or config files to configure for different environments.

## Architecture Details

### Service Layer

The backend follows a modular service architecture:

- Each service handles a specific domain (identity, payments, compliance, etc.)
- Services are stateless and receive database connections via dependency injection
- All business logic is contained within service methods

### Middleware

- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics collection
- **Request ID**: Request tracing and correlation
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing

### Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database contains the following main tables:

- `users` - User accounts and Stellar addresses
- `plans` - Inheritance plans with beneficiary and payout options
- `claims` - Record of plan claims by beneficiaries
- `admins`, `kyc_status`, `two_fa`, `notifications`, `logs` - Supporting tables

 Plans and beneficiary / currency

Plans store optional beneficiary bank details and payout currency preference:

- **beneficiary_name** – Full name of the beneficiary
- **bank_account_number** – Account number for fiat transfers
- **bank_name** – Name of the beneficiary's bank
- **currency_preference** – `USDC` (crypto) or `FIAT` (bank transfer)

**Currency handling:**

- **USDC**: Bank fields are optional; payout is processed as USDC transfer.
- **FIAT**: `beneficiary_name`, `bank_name`, and `bank_account_number` are required when creating a plan or when claiming with FIAT preference. Missing or invalid bank info returns a 400 error.

## Loan Simulation API

The Loan Simulation API allows borrowers to preview loan terms before committing to a loan. It calculates:

- **Required Collateral**: The minimum collateral value needed based on the collateral type's Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio
- **Estimated Interest**: Interest calculated based on the loan amount, duration, and collateral type's annual interest rate
- **Liquidation Price**: The price at which the collateral would be liquidated if its value drops below the liquidation threshold

### Supported Collateral Types

| Collateral | LTV Ratio | Annual Interest Rate | Liquidation Threshold |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| USDC       | 90%       | 5%                  | 95%                  |
| ETH        | 75%       | 8%                  | 85%                  |
| BTC        | 75%       | 8%                  | 85%                  |
| STELLAR_XLM| 60%       | 12%                 | 80%                  |

### Calculation Formulas

- **Required Collateral (USD)**: `loan_amount / LTV_ratio`
- **Collateral Quantity**: `required_collateral_usd / collateral_price_usd`
- **Estimated Interest**: `loan_amount * annual_interest_rate * (duration_days / 365)`
- **Total Repayment**: `loan_amount + estimated_interest`
- **Liquidation Price**: `(loan_amount / liquidation_threshold) / collateral_quantity`

## Database Connection Pool Configuration

The backend uses `sqlx`'s `PgPool` with configurable connection pool settings. All values are read from environment variables at startup and fall back to safe defaults when not set.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DB_POOL_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `10` | Maximum number of connections in the pool |
| `DB_POOL_MIN_CONNECTIONS` | `2` | Minimum number of idle connections to maintain |
| `DB_POOL_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `30` | Seconds to wait for a free connection before failing |
| `DB_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `600` | Seconds before an idle connection is closed |
| `DB_POOL_MAX_LIFETIME_SECS` | `1800` | Maximum age of any connection regardless of activity |
| `DB_POOL_CONNECT_RETRIES` | `5` | Startup retry attempts when the database is unreachable |
| `DB_POOL_CONNECT_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_SECS` | `2` | Base delay (seconds) for startup retry back-off |

### Recommended Values by Environment

| Setting | Development | Staging | Production |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DB_POOL_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `5` | `10` | `20–50` |
| `DB_POOL_MIN_CONNECTIONS` | `1` | `2` | `5` |
| `DB_POOL_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `30` | `30` | `10` |
| `DB_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `300` | `600` | `600` |
| `DB_POOL_MAX_LIFETIME_SECS` | `900` | `1800` | `1800` |
| `DB_POOL_CONNECT_RETRIES` | `3` | `5` | `5` |
| `DB_POOL_CONNECT_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_SECS` | `1` | `2` | `2` |

### Sizing Guidance

- **`max_connections`**: A common starting formula is `(num_cpu_cores × 2) + effective_spindle_count`. For a 4-core production host, 10–20 is a reasonable starting point. Always leave headroom below PostgreSQL's `max_connections` server limit for admin connections and other services.
- **`min_connections`**: Keeping a small warm pool (2–5) avoids cold-start latency after idle periods.
- **`acquire_timeout_secs`**: Lower values (10 s) in production surface pool exhaustion quickly rather than silently queuing requests.
- **`idle_timeout_secs` / `max_lifetime_secs`**: Prevents stale connections after PostgreSQL restarts or network topology changes. `max_lifetime_secs` should always be ≥ `idle_timeout_secs`.

### Example `.env` (Production)

```env
DB_POOL_MAX_CONNECTIONS=20
DB_POOL_MIN_CONNECTIONS=5
DB_POOL_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_SECS=10
DB_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS=600
DB_POOL_MAX_LIFETIME_SECS=1800
DB_POOL_CONNECT_RETRIES=5
DB_POOL_CONNECT_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_SECS=2
```
